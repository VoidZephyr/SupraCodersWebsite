## **Getting Started**  

### **1. Clone the Repository**  
Run the following command:  
```bash
git clone git@github.com:jsanders36/Capstone-SDI18-SupraDev.git
cd Capstone-SDI18-SupraDev
```

### **2. Backend Setup**  
1. Open the project in VSCode:  
   ```bash
   code .
   ```
2. Open a terminal in VSCode:  
   ```bash
   ctrl/command + shift + J
   ```
3. Navigate to the backend folder:  
   ```bash
   cd api
   ```
4. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
5. Ensure Docker is running:  
   ```bash
   docker --version
   ```
6. Start a PostgreSQL container:  
   ```bash
   docker run --rm --name pg-docker -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=docker -d -p 5432:5432 -v $HOME/docker/volumes/postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data postgres
   ```
7. Create the database:  
   ```bash
   docker exec -it [ContainerID] bash
   psql -U postgres
   CREATE DATABASE supradb;
   ```

8. Run migrations and seed the database:  
   ```bash
   cd api
   npx knex migrate:latest
   npx knex seed:run
   ```
9. Start the backend server:  
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

---

### **3. Frontend Setup**  
1. Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend:  
   ```bash
   cd ui

3. Start the frontend:  
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
4. Open the application in your browser:  
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

## **Testing**  

### **Backend API Testing**  
1. A test database, `supradb_test`, is used for testing.  
2. Ensure the `pg-docker` container is running.  
3. Create the test database using:  
   ```bash
   sudo bash ./test/supradb_test_create.sh supradb_test pg-docker
   ```
4. Run tests with Jest:  
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
5. After testing, destroy the test database:  
   ```bash
   sudo bash ./test/supradb_test_destroy.sh supradb_test pg-docker
   ```

---

## **Troubleshooting**  
If you encounter **PostgreSQL version conflicts**, specify the version when running the container:  
```bash
docker run --rm --name pg-docker -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=docker -p 5432:5432 -v $HOME/docker/volumes/postgres:/var/lib/postgresql@15/data postgres
```
Ensure the correct version matches your existing data directory.
